# Vision

architecture-based roadmap



1. Clear Learning Objectives: Clearly define the learning objectives for each topic and ensure they align with the level of proficiency targeted for each level (LLA, ILA, HLA). This will help students understand what they are expected to achieve and enable them to track their progress.
2. Comprehensive Coverage: Ensure that each topic is covered in sufficient depth, providing comprehensive explanations, examples, and hands-on exercises. The materials should address both theoretical concepts and practical implementation aspects.
3. Practical Examples and Exercises: Include real-world examples and hands-on exercises to reinforce the learning and give students an opportunity to apply their knowledge. Encourage them to build projects or complete coding exercises to solidify their understanding.
4. Best Practices and Standards: Emphasize best practices, coding standards, and industry standards throughout the materials. Help students develop good coding habits, maintainable code, and adhere to security and performance best practices.
5. Clarity and Structure: Present the content in a clear and structured manner, using appropriate headings, subheadings, and bullet points. Break down complex topics into digestible sections to make the learning process more manageable.
6. Visual Aids: Use diagrams, flowcharts, and illustrations where appropriate to enhance understanding and provide visual representations of concepts. Visual aids can make abstract concepts more tangible and easier to grasp.
7. Practical Tips and Insights: Share practical tips, insights, and real-world experiences to provide context and guidance. These can help students gain a deeper understanding of how concepts are applied in real projects and encourage them to think critically about their implementation.
8. Updates and Revisions: Continuously update and revise the materials to keep them up-to-date with the latest advancements in ASP.NET Core and Vue. Stay informed about new features, best practices, and industry trends to ensure the content remains relevant and valuable.
9. Collaboration and Feedback: Encourage collaboration and feedback from students, fellow educators, and industry professionals. Actively seek input and suggestions for improvement, and incorporate them into the materials to enhance their quality.
10. Continuous Improvement: Treat the WoW 2.0 project as an ongoing endeavor for continuous improvement. Regularly evaluate the materials, gather feedback, and make updates as needed to provide the best learning experience for students.

Goals

* Separate topics by levels even related ones&#x20;
  * Eg : teaching `Thread` type along with async/await can create a lot of questions
